# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to the EPITA Deep Learning Course!**

You'll find tutorials and practical work in the [Tutorials](/articles) section.

The goal of these practical works is to get you started in ML very quickly by going through a lot of notions from the very [basics of neural networks](/articles/mlp/tp-1/) to more complex topics that involves [understanding modern research](/articles/cv/tp-4/), architectures ([Convolutional Neural Networks](/articles/cv/tp-2/), [Diffusion Models](/articles/cv/tp-3/)), learning how to efficiently go beyond by [reading research efficiently](/articles/others/tp-4/), and [more](/articles/)!

[Chady Dimachkie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chady-dimachkie/) has a proven track record in machine learning and artificial intelligence across several prominent companies. At [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com), he contributed to the development of [Nvidia DLSS v1](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/), that introduced AI Super Resolution technology in video games enhancing image quality and speed in AAA games such as [Battlefield](https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield) and [Shadow of the Tomb Raider](https://press.na.square-enix.com/Shadow-of-the-Tomb-Raider). At [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com), he optimized customer services by working on a state-of-the-art semantic similarity search engine, part of which helped contribute to popular ML tools such as Sentence Transformers. His work at Ubisoft also earned him credits in several games such as [Assassin\'s Creed Valhalla](https://www.mobygames.com/person/1160477/chady-dimachkie/), [Watch Dogs: Legion](https://www.mobygames.com/person/1160477/chady-dimachkie/) and [more](https://devtrackers.gg/hyper-scape/p/703f9bac-credits-emea). As a Founding Machine Learning Engineer and first employee at [Ntropy](https://www.ntropy.com/), he played a pivotal role in growing the company from 3 to 25+ employees, which secured an [$11M Series A funding](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/12/ntropy-raises-cash-to-normalize-and-classify-transaction-data/), and now has high-profile clients like Teampay or Wayflyer. He also researched [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](/portfolio/), Large Language Models (LLMs) and efficient data annotation techniques. Currently, Chady is the Head of ML at a stealth startup, where he is scaling the ML team and building models for data extraction and insight generation for risk modeling. Additionally, he teaches advanced Deep Learning and Neural Networks to master's students at [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/en) in Paris.
