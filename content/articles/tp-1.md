In this first practical work, we'll be experimenting with simple neural networks on simple datasets.

# Get Setup

It's recommended to use a Jupyter notebook since you'll be doing some visualization.

## Locally

You should have `Jupyter` installed and the following dependencies. You can use `pip` or any other dependency manager:

```sh
pip install torch matplotlib
```

## In The Cloud *(Google Colab)*

Simply click [here to open a Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your browser. You'll need to sign-in with you Google account.

# Let's Get Started

In this first practical work you'll be creating a simple neural network in PyTorch to fit multiple simple datasets.

**Let's get started !**

## Why PyTorch?

PyTorch is one of the leading open-source machine learning frameworks to design, train and run inference on neural networks. It is developped by Meta AI.

A lot of machine learning software made by big companies is made using PyTorch, even the Tesla for their Autopilot
