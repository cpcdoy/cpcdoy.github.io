In this third practical work, we'll be learning **How to Read a Machine Learning Paper**.

# How to Read a Machine Learning Paper?

As someone studying machine learning, you'll have to read a technical paper at several points in your life to review the current literature on the specific topic you want to research. Doing a *literature review* is essential when starting to work on a subject: People have probably already looked into the topic you want to study, so learning from their previous work will help you save time and reach a solution faster.

Reading papers in ML is not always simple, since ML is a complex filed applied to many different domains, you'll have to have previous knowledge of mathematics to understand the formulas, you'll need to have a background in programming since ML is literally **Machine** Learning and on top of all that, you might need to learn some of the specifics of the field your paper is being applied to: e.g. It could be a paper on an ML model applied to the medical field or to finance.


- Where's the research currently at on your topic of interest?
- What are the challenges typically encountered?
- What are the best solutions available at your disposal?
  - Is there any available code or even usable product out of this research paper?
- What are the limitations of the current solutions?
- What are the possible solutions that should be explored in the future?

This assumes 

Now, not every paper will be useful or worth your time. It's important to be able to effectively read a paper and see if it'll help you or not. Understanding that the field of ML can sometimes be driver by labs that need to publish and paper counts, etc etc
